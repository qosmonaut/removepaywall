# Remove Paywall Bookmarklet

This is a simple bookmarklet to access content behind a paywall by using https://removepaywall.com

Simply select and drag the JavaScript or HTML snippet below to the bookmarks bar to add it as a bookmark.
The HTML code creates a bookmark with a title, whereas the JS code does not.

```js
javascript:window.location='https://removepaywall.com/'+window.location
```

```html
<a href="javascript:window.location='https://removepaywall.com/'+window.location">Remove Paywall</a>
```
